In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding
style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your
code.

_Also, please don't edit files in the "dist" subdirectory as they are generated
automatically. You'll find source code in the "src" subdirectory!_
