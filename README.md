_(Coming soon)_

## Running Tests
Right now to run tests, you need to have [node](https://github.com/joyent/node) installed
as well as the following packages (inside the `tests` folder):

* [mocha](https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha) `npm install mocha`
* [chai](https://github.com/logicalparadox/chai/) `npm install chai`
* [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom) `npm install jsdom`

Then either open the
[index.html](https://github.com/Couto/VisualHash/blob/master/tests/index.html)
in your browser window or run `./tests/node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha
tests/index.js` in your terminal from the root folder.

## Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding
style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your
code.

_Also, please don't edit files in the "dist" subdirectory as they are generated
automatically. You'll find source code in the "src" subdirectory!_

## TODO
* Make Makefile to run tests, minify and create dist files.
* Finish tests
* Fix JSCoverage to better replicate the script usage
* Write default CSS
